Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Uma, Olohi, Yuyao Zhu 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Office hours with Jordan Friday morning 2/9

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    The documentation is really different than R or Python documentation, which is kind of confusing to understand how each individual method works, but I like that I can see all the methods easily and a brief summary of what they do. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I'm started visualizing the structures of Java vs. Python a bit like root systems. Python has a fiberous, monocot like system where everything is interconnected, and it's slightly easier to trace across a method to an object. Java has a tuberous system. Technically you can probably get from point A to point B all the same, but first you need to get to a new tuber (Class) before you can reach out into its associated methods. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I tried a lot of different methods for replacing and searching over the user input, including: breaking into an array, breaking into a list, keeping it as a string and evaluating the whole thing at once. For a while (up until 9 pm Tuesday night lol) I was satisfied with the "keep as string" approach, but it didn't work super well when some pronouns showed up in the same sentence in a certain order (aka when "you" appeared before "I"). I eventually asked ChatGPT to figure out a way to turn a list of words into a string separated by spaces (the part about splitting into an array that was tripping me up before), and it ended up working!! I am usually stubborn about using chatGPT because I don't like that it takes the agency of learning away from me, but I was so lost on different Java string classes that this time it was actually really helpful. For future students, I would reccommend not shying away from AI necessarily, but to ask it the most specific problem possible, so that it is really provide syntax guidance as opposed to strategizing.
