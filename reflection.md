- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    The documentation is really different than R or Python documentation, which is kind of confusing to understand how each individual method works, but I like that I can see all the methods easily and a brief summary of what they do. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I'm started visualizing the structures of Java vs. Python a bit like root systems. Python has a fiberous, monocot like system where everything is interconnected, and it's slightly easier to trace across a method to an object. Java has a tuberous system. Technically you can probably get from point A to point B all the same, but first you need to get to a new tuber (Class) before you can reach out into its associated methods. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I tried a lot of different methods for replacing and searching over the user input, including: breaking into an array, breaking into a list, keeping it as a sring and evaluating the whole thing at once. None of those worked super well -- breaking it into an array got me the furthest, but I had a lot of difficulty putting it back into a string. Eventually I managed to googl ethe correct terms and find the stackoverflow question that showed me I could break the string into a list within the for loop and not save it, which was really helpful. I would reccommend that people approach this by thinking of the path of fewest steps, because each conversion of the input is an opportunity for the data type to get fussy. After coming up with the path of fewest steps, do a lot of googling to figure out the way to approach that in Java syntax.
